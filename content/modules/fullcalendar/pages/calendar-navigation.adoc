= 2. FullCalendar navigation

The user should have the capability to see next and previous dates or scroll to a specific time in the time-grid calendar views. Currently, our application does not offer this functionality.

[[date-navigation]]
== Date navigation

`FullCalendar` provides methods for next and previous navigation. The "step" of next and previous navigation depends on the current calendar view.

Firstly, add buttons to *MyCalendar* view above the calendar:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex1/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/mycalendar/my-calendar.xml[tags=onboarding-calendar-navigation1]
----

Then, follow these steps to implement calendar navigation:

* Inject `calendar` component
* Subscribe to xref:flow-ui:vc/components/button.adoc#ClickEvent[ClickEvent] for the `previousButton`
* Subscribe to xref:flow-ui:vc/components/button.adoc#ClickEvent[ClickEvent] for the `nextButton`

We will use the following methods of the `FullCalendar` component:

* `navigateToPrevious()`.
* `navigateToNext()`.

As a result, users will be able to navigate to the next and previous months.

[[time-scrolling]]
== Time scrolling

By default, the `FullCalendar` component displays the month view, which may be redundant due to the small number of events, plus it does not show the time grid. Let's change the initial calendar view and set up the time to which the component should scroll initially.

The `scrollTime` attribute takes the string which is parsed by `java.time.Duration`. The `Duration` takes the following variants of time:

* `"P1d"` - 1 day.
* `"PT1h"` - 1 hour.
* `"PT30m"` - 30 minutes.
* `"P1dT1h30m"` - 1 day plus 1 hour and 30 minutes.
