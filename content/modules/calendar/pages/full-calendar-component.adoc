== Basic

`FullCalendar` component is available in the *Add Component* palette of the Studio xref:studio:view-designer.adoc[View Designer] as soon as you install add-on in your project.

To create the component, use `calendar` XML element.
If you need to show events, bind `containerEventProvider` to xref:flow-ui:data/data-containers.adoc[data container].

The following example demonstrates how a basic `calendar` is created:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/sample-basic.xml[tags=sample-basic1]
----

== Data Binding

The calendar component uses data providers to link loaded data and visualize it.
The data item should implement the <<CalendarEvent>> interface in order to be shown in the component.
In case of JPA or DTO entity, there is a <<ContainerCalendarDataProvider>> that wraps an entity to the <<EntityCalendarEvent>>.

=== CalendarEvent

The base interface for events in the calendar component. It has the following properties:

[cols="1h,6a",grid=none]
|===
| [[id]]id
| A unique ID of calendar event. Is used for identification on client-side.

| [[groupId]]groupId
| The group object that is shared between other evens. Events with the same group ID will be dragged and resized together automatically.

| [[allDay]]allDay
| Determines if the event is shown in the "all-day" section of relevant display mode.
By default, component consider value all events as non-all-day.

The `null` value means not all day event.

| [[startDateTime]]startDateTime
| Defines start date-time position of event. It has the `LocalDateTime` type, and the value should correspond to system default time zone. For <<EntityCalendarEvent>>, the value will be automatically transformed from supported date-time datatype .

| [[endDateTime]]endDateTime
| Defines end date-time position of event. It has the `LocalDateTime` type, and the value should correspond to system default time zone. For <<EntityCalendarEvent>>, the value will be automatically transformed from supported date-time datatype .

This value is *exclusive*. For instance, an event with end date-tme property -
`2024-09-03` will appear to span through `2024-09-02` but before the start of `2024-09-03`.

| [[title]]title
| The text that will appear on an event.

| [[description]]description
| The text of event description.

| [[interactive]]interactive
| Specifies whether events can be navigated using the TAB key.

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage event interactivity based on the <<eventInteractive, eventInteractive>> property.

| [[classNames]]classNames
| Specifies class names separated by space that should be attached to the rendered event.

| [[startEditable]]startEditable
| Determines whether an event can be dragged in the calendar component.

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage event's draggable feature based on the <<eventStartEditable, eventStartEditable>> property.

| [[durationEditable]]durationEditable
| Determines whether an event can be resized in the calendar component.

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage event's resizable feature based on the <<eventDurationEditable, eventDurationEditable>> property.

| [[display]]display
| Defines the type of event rendering.  If not specified, the `AUTO` value will be used.

| [[overlap]]overlap
| Defines whether the event can be dragged/resized over other events and prevents other events from being dragged/resized over this event.

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage this feature based on the <<eventOverlap, eventOverlap>> property or specific JavaScript function.

| [[constraint]]constraint
| Defines a group ID of other events. This property limits dragging and resizing to a certain cells in component.

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage event's constraint based on the <<eventConstraintGroupId, eventConstraintGroupId>> or <<eventConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled, eventConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled>> properties.

| [[backgroundColor]]backgroundColor
| Specifies the background color for event. Supported values are:

- `#f00`
- `#ff0000`
- `rgb(255,0,0)`
- Color name - 'red'

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage event's background color based on the <<eventBackgroundColor, eventBackgroundColor>> property.

| [[borderColor]]borderColor
| Specifies the border color for event. Supported values are:

- `#f00`
- `#ff0000`
- `rgb(255,0,0)`
- Color name - 'red'

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage event's border color based on the <<eventBorderColor, eventBorderColor>> property.

| [[textColor]]textColor
| Specifies the text color for event. Supported values are:

- `#f00`
- `#ff0000`
- `rgb(255,0,0)`
- Color name - 'red'

If this value is `null`, the calendar will manage event's text color based on the <<eventTextColor, eventTextColor>> property.

| [[additionalProperties]]additionalProperties
| Defines additional properties and their values that will be available in various JavaScript functions that takes an event as parameter.

| [[recurringDaysOfWeek]]recurringDaysOfWeek
| Specifies the days of the week this event repeats. If omitted, the event is assumed to repeat every day.

| [[recurringStartDate]]recurringStartDate
| Specifies the date when the recurrences of this event start. If not specified, the recurrences will extend infinitely into the past.

| [[recurringEndDate]]recurringEndDate
| Specifies the date when the recurrences of this event end. If not specified, the recurrences will extend infinitely into the future.

Note that this value is *exclusive*. For all-day recurring events, set the end date to the day after your desired last recurrence.

| [[recurringStartTime]]recurringStartTime
| Specifies the start time of a recurring event. If this is not defined, the event is considered an all-day event.

Note that the calendar does not apply time zone conversion for this property. If the OffsetTime datatype is used in the entity, it will be transformed to the system's default time zone.

| [[recurringEndTime]]recurringEndTime
| Specifies the end time of a recurring event. If this is not defined, the event will appear to have the default duration as configured by the <<defaultTimedEventDuration, defaultTimedEventDuration>> property.

|===

==== EntityCalendarEvent

The implementation of <<CalendarEvent>> that works with JPA or DTO entities. When <<ContainerCalendarDataProvider>> links with xref:flow-ui:data/collection-container.adoc[collection container] it automatically wraps loaded entities to `EntityCalendarEvent` and pass it to the component. For instance, in this case all calendar events are `EntityCalendarEvent`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/sample-entity-calendar-event.xml[tags=sample-entity-calendar-event1]
----

And you can safely cast to `EntityCalendarEvent`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/SampleEntityCalendarEvent.java[tags=sample-entity-calendar-event2]
----

==== SimpleCalendarEvent

The simple POJO class that implements <<CalendarEvent>> interface.  You can use this event class as an alternative to creating DTOs or for prototyping purposes. It also includes a builder class to facilitate the convenient creation of event instances.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/java/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/SampleSimpleCalendarEventView.java[tags=sample-simple-calendar-event1]
----

==== Recurring events

Recurring events are events that occur multiple times at regular intervals, following a predefined schedule. In `FullCalendar` you can configure the schedule by the following properties of `CalendarEvent`:

 - <<recurringDaysOfWeek, recurringDaysOfWeek>>
 - <<recurringStartDate, recurringStartDate>>
 - <<recurringEndDate, recurringEndDate>>
 - <<recurringStartTime, recurringStartTime>>
 - <<recurringEndTime, recurringEndTime>>

If any of these recurrence properties are specified, `FullCalendar` assumes the event is recurring and ignores the <<startDateTime, startDateTime>> and <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> properties.

When the data provider specifies recurrence properties, the single repeating event in the container will be expanded into individual events instances with their own dates in `FullCalendar`. However, the container will still contain the single recurring event.

You can specify recurrence properties in the data provider as shown below:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$fullcalendar-ex2/src/main/resources/com/company/fullcalendarsample/view/demos/sample-recurring-events-view.xml[tags=sample-recurring-events1]
----

==== Recurrence event and Group ID property

The `FullCalendar` expands single recurring event into individual events instances. These events act as not related events. For instance, if you specify the <<eventStartEditable, eventStartEditable>> property, you can get the following behaviour with recurring events:

image::move-recurring-event-no-groupid.png[align="center"]

If you want all the recurring events in a definition to move together, you need to specify the <<groupId, groupId>> property of <<CalendarEvent>>.

image::move-recurring-event-groupid.png[align="center"]

==== DaysOfWeek Datatype

The <<recurringDaysOfWeek, recurringDaysOfWeek>> property defines the list of days of the week and requires a specific datatype to store it in JPA or DTO entities - `DaysOfWeek`.

The Studio provides this type when you add an attribute to a JPA or DTO entity.

image::add-recurring-days-of-week-attribute.png[align="center"]

In the UI you can edit `DaysOfWeek` using xref:flow-ui:vc/components/valuePicker.adoc[] and `DaysOfWeekEditAction`.

In Jmix there are many xref:flow-ui:vc/common-attributes.adoc[common attributes] that serve the same purpose for all components.
The following are attributes specific to `calendar`:

[cols="1h,7a,1",grid=rows,frame=none]
|===
|*Name*|*Description*|*Default*

|[[allDayMaintainDurationEnabled]]allDayMaintainDurationEnabled
| Determines how an event’s duration should be mutated when it is dragged from a timed section to an all-day section and vice versa.

- `true` - the duration will remain roughly the same before and after it is dragged to or from an all-day section. "Roughly" because if an event has a duration with hourly precision, it will be rounded down to the nearest whole-day.

- `false` - the event’s duration will be reset to <<defaultAllDayEventDuration, defaultAllDayEventDuration>> if it is being dropped in an all-day section or <<defaultTimedEventDuration, defaultTimedEventDuration>> if it is being dropped in a timed section

| `false`

|[[allDayText]]allDayText
| Sets the all-day text. The text is visible in time-grid display modes.
|

|[[closeHint]]closeHint
| Sets the hint for the close button in the popover when you click the "more" link.
|

|[[dateAlignment]]dateAlignment
| Sets the first visible date of <<CustomCalendarDisplayMode>>.

When a custom calendar display mode is being used, and you’d like to guarantee that the calendar begins at a certain interval, like the start-of-week or start-of-month, specify a value like `week` or `month`. If the property is not specified, a reasonable default will be generated based on the display mode’s duration.

If a display mode’s range is explicitly defined by visible date range, this property will be ignored.
|

|[[dayHeadersVisible]]dayHeadersVisible
| Sets whether the day headers should appear. It works for day-grid, time-grid and month display modes.
| `true`

|[[dayMaxEventRows]]dayMaxEventRows
| Sets rows count of events in day-grid display modes and in "all-day" section in time-grid display modes.

Note that "more" row is included to count. For instance, if the value is `1`, only the "more" row will be shown. Takes precedence over the <<defaultDayMaxEventRowsEnabled, defaultDayMaxEventRowsEnabled>>.
|

|[[dayMaxEvents]]dayMaxEvents
| Sets rows count of events in day-grid display modes and in "all-day" section in time-grid display modes.

Note that "+ more" row is not included to count. For instance, if the value is  `1`, one event and the "more" row will be shown. Takes precedence over the <<defaultDayMaxEventsEnabled, defaultDayMaxEventsEnabled>>.
|

|[[dayOfYear]]dayOfYear
| The rule how to define the first week of the year. For instance, if the first day of the week is `1` and the day of year equals to `4`, it means that the week that contains `Jan 4th` is the first week of the year.
|

|[[defaultAllDay]]defaultAllDay
| Sets the default value for each calendar event's <<allDay, allDay>> property when it is unspecified.

If the property is set to `true`, all events without <<allDay, allDay>> property (e.g. is not specified mapping in a data provider or calendar event returns `null` for this property) will be considered as all-day events.

Note, in this case, events without <<allDay, allDay>> property will be shown as all-day events. If such event will be changed by dragging or resizing, and you have listeners for these events, the component will apply changes to a calendar event, which can lead to modifying entity/ DTO instance.
| `false`

|[[defaultAllDayEventDuration]]defaultAllDayEventDuration
| Sets the default duration of all-day events if they don't specify <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property.

For instance, the property is set to 2 days. The event that has <<allDay, allDay>> property equals to `true` and do not have <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property, will be shown in all-day section and will occupy two days.

Note, calendar event's <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property will remain unset, unless <<forceEventDuration, forceEventDuration>> has been set to `true`. In this case, the calendar will explicitly assign end date-time to an event. If such event will be changed by dragging or resizing, and you have listeners for these events, the component will set to calendar event end date-time value, which can lead to modifying entity/ DTO instance.

This property only affects events with <<allDay, allDay>> property equals to `true`.
| `P1d`

|[[defaultBusinessHoursEnabled]]defaultBusinessHoursEnabled
| Enables default business hours. The default business hour is: `monday - friday` from `9 AM` to `5 PM`.
| `false`

|[[defaultDayHeaderFormat]]defaultDayHeaderFormat
| Sets the format of the text that will be displayed on the calendar’s column headings.

By default, component sets localized format from `messages` when is created.
This property act as default format for all display modes and for <<CustomCalendarDisplayMode>> until specific property won't be set for these display modes. However, all display-mode properties objects by default explicitly specify the format, thus they override this property.

As component uses https://fullcalendar.io/docs/moment-plugin[moment plugin] for `FullCalendar`, you should follow the `moment.js` formatting rules: https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/[Moment.js Documentation]. For instance, the `dd` produces the `Mo` value.

The property change is not applied after component attached to the UI.
|

|[[defaultDayMaxEventRowsEnabled]]defaultDayMaxEventRowsEnabled
| Limits the maximum number of stacked events within a given day.

- `true` - limits the number of events by height of the day cell.

- `false` - component displays all events as is.

This property is applied for day-grid display modes and in all-day cells.
| `false`

|[[defaultDayMaxEventsEnabled]]defaultDayMaxEventsEnabled
| Limits the maximum number of stacked events within a given day.

- `true` - limits the number of events by height of the day cell.

- `false` - component displays all events as is.

This property is applied for day-grid display modes and in all-day cells.
| `false`

|[[defaultDayPopoverFormat]]defaultDayPopoverFormat
| Sets the date format of title of the popover that is shown when "more" link is clicked. By default, component sets localized format from `messages` when is created.

This property act as default format for all display modes and for <<CustomCalendarDisplayMode>> until specific property won't be set for these display modes. However, all display-mode properties objects by default explicitly specify the format, thus they override this property.

As component uses https://fullcalendar.io/docs/moment-plugin[moment plugin] for `FullCalendar`, you should follow the `moment.js` formatting rules: https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/[Moment.js Documentation]. For instance, the `MMM D, YY` produces the `Sep 9, 24` value.

The property change is not applied after component attached to the UI.
|

|[[defaultEventTimeFormat]]defaultEventTimeFormat
| Sets the format of the time-text that will be displayed on each event. By default, component sets localized format from `messages` when is created.

This property act as default format for all display modes and for <<CustomCalendarDisplayMode>> until specific property won't be set for these display modes. However, all display-mode properties objects by default explicitly specify the format, thus they override this property.

As component uses https://fullcalendar.io/docs/moment-plugin[moment plugin] for `FullCalendar`, you should follow the `moment.js` formatting rules: https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/[Moment.js Documentation]. For instance, the `HH:mm` produces the `00:00` (01, 2, ... 23 : 01, 02 ... 59).

The property change is not applied after component attached to the UI.
|

|[[defaultSlotLabelFormat]]defaultSlotLabelFormat
| Sets the format of the text that will be displayed within a time slot. By default, component sets localized format from `messages` when is created.

This property act as default format for all display modes and for <<CustomCalendarDisplayMode>> until specific property won't be set for these display modes. However, all display-mode properties objects by default explicitly specify the format, thus they override this property.

As component uses https://fullcalendar.io/docs/moment-plugin[moment plugin] for `FullCalendar`, you should follow the `moment.js` formatting rules: https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/[Moment.js Documentation]. For instance, the `ha` produces `1 am` (1, 2, ... 12 am/ pm).

The property change is not applied after component attached to the UI.
|

|[[defaultTimedEventDuration]]defaultTimedEventDuration
| Sets the default duration for timed events if they don't specify <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property.

For instance, the property is set to 2 hours. The event that has <<allDay, allDay>>`  property equals to  `false` and do not have <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property, will occupy two hours in time slots.

Note, calendar event's <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property will remain unset, unless <<forceEventDuration, forceEventDuration>> has been set to `true`. In this case, the calendar will explicitly assign end date to an event. If such event will be changed by dragging or resizing, and you have listeners for these events, the component will set new value to calendar event's <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property, which can lead to modifying entity/ DTO instance.

This property only affects events with `allDay` property equals to `false`.
| `PT1h`

|[[defaultWeekNumberFormat]]defaultWeekNumberFormat
| Sets the format of the week number that will be displayed when <<weekNumbersVisible, weekNumbersVisible>> is `true`. By default, component sets localized format from `messages` when is created.

This property act as default format for all display modes and for <<CustomCalendarDisplayMode>> until specific property won't be set for these display modes. However, all display-mode properties objects by default explicitly specify the format, thus they override this property.

As component uses https://fullcalendar.io/docs/moment-plugin[moment plugin] for `FullCalendar`, you should follow the `moment.js` formatting rules: https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/[Moment.js Documentation]. For instance, the `[Week] w` produces the `Week 1` (1, 2, ... 52, 53).

The property change is not applied after component attached to the UI.
|

|[[displayEventTime]]displayEventTime
| Determines visibility of time text of each event.

The property applies to timed-events (not all-day). If set to `true`, time text will always be displayed on the event. If set to `false`, time text will never be displayed on the event. Events that are all-day will never display time text anyhow.
| `true`

|[[dragRevertDuration]]dragRevertDuration
| Sets the time it takes for an event to revert to its original position after an unsuccessful drag.
| `500`

|[[dragScroll]]dragScroll
| Enables to automatically scroll the scroll-containers during event drag-and-drop and date selecting.

The property change is not applied after component attached to the UI.
| `true`

|[[eventBackgroundColor]]eventBackgroundColor
| Sets the background color for all events on the calendar.

Note, calendar events can override this value if they specify <<backgroundColor, backgroundColor>> property.

Supported values are:

- `#f00`

- `#ff0000`

- `rgb(255,0,0)`

- Color name - `red`
|

|[[eventBorderColor]]eventBorderColor
| Sets the border color for all events on the calendar.

Note, calendar events can override this value if they specify <<borderColor, borderColor>> property.

Supported values are:

- `#f00`

- `#ff0000`

- `rgb(255,0,0)`

- Color name - `red`
|

|[[eventConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled]]eventConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled
| Sets whether events being dragged or resized must be fully contained within the week’s business hours. It also respects custom business hours.
| `false`

|[[eventConstraintGroupId]]eventConstraintGroupId
| Sets a group ID to limit the dragging and resizing of events. Events that are being dragged or resized must be fully contained by at least one of the events linked to by the given group ID.

Takes precedence over <<eventConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled, eventConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled>>.

The group ID can be an entity instance, string, enum or other types.
|

|[[eventDisplay]]eventDisplay
| Sets the display mode that controls the appearance of all events that do not specify display mode.

To control the display of specific events, use the <<display, display>> property of calendar event.
| `AUTO`

|[[eventDragMinDistance]]eventDragMinDistance
| Sets how many pixels the user’s mouse/touch must move before an event drag activates.
| `5`

|[[eventDurationEditable]]eventDurationEditable
| Enables to edit event duration using resizing. This property can be overridden on per-event by <<durationEditable, durationEditable>> property.
| `false`

|[[eventHint]]eventHint
| Sets for list display modes' non-visible table header the name of the column with event names.
|

|[[eventInteractive]]eventInteractive
| Enables to edit event duration using resizing

This property can be overridden on per-event by <<interactive, interactive>> property.
| `false`

|[[eventLongPressDelay]]eventLongPressDelay
| Sets the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the user must hold down before an event becomes draggable on touch devices.
| `1000`

|[[eventMaxStack]]eventMaxStack
| Sets the maximum number of events that stack top-to-bottom for time-grid display modes.
|

|[[eventOrder]]eventOrder
| Sets the list of calendar event properties that should participate in sorting. It is also available to specify properties from event's <<additionalProperties, additionalProperties>> property.

For most calendar display modes, this property determines the vertical ordering of events within the same day. For time-grid display modes however, it determines the horizontal ordering of events within the same time slot.

The default value puts earlier events first. If tied, it puts longer events first. If still tied, it puts all-day events first. If still tied, orders events by title, alphabetically.

If putting a lower-precedent event before a higher-precedent improves compactness, the algorithm will do so. To disable this behavior, set <<eventOrderStrict, eventOrderStrict>> to `true`.

The provided properties are sorted in ascending order. If a property is prefixed with a minus sign like `-title`, sorting will be in descending order.
| `start,-duration,allDay,title`

|[[eventOrderStrict]]eventOrderStrict
| Enables the component to strictly follow the specified event order.

The `false` value, meaning the event order is not strict and compactness will be prioritized over following event order exactly.
| `false`

|[[eventOverlap]]eventOverlap
| Allows events to overlap each other during dragging and resizing.
| `true`

|[[eventResizableFromStart]]eventResizableFromStart
| Enables to resize an event from its starting date.
| `false`

|[[eventStartEditable]]eventStartEditable
| Enables to edit event start time using dragging.

This property can be overridden on per-event by <<startEditable, startEditable>> property.
| `false`

|[[eventTextColor]]eventTextColor
| Sets the text color for all events on the calendar.

Note, calendar events can override this value if they specify <<textColor, textColor>> property.

Supported values are:

- `#f00`

- `#ff0000`

- `rgb(255,0,0)`

- Color name - `red`

The color applies in time-grid display modes and for all-day events in day-grid display modes.
|

|[[expandRows]]expandRows
| Enables to expand rows of time-grid display modes if they don’t take up the entire height.
| `false`

|[[firstDayOfWeek]]firstDayOfWeek
| Sets the day that each week begins. The default value is taken from locale.
|

|[[forceEventDuration]]forceEventDuration
| Makes the component to assign <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property value to events if they do not have it.

Note, if event does not specify <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property, the component will set it explicitly. If such event will be changed by dragging or resizing, and you have listeners for these events, the component will set new value to calendar event <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property, which can lead to modifying entity/ DTO instance.
| `false`

|[[initialDate]]initialDate
| Sets the initial date that will be displayed when the component is attached to UI. If not specified, the current date will be used.

The property change is not applied after component attached to the UI.
|

|[[navigationLinksEnabled]]navigationLinksEnabled
| Enables navigation to date using day names and week names.
| `false`

|[[nextDayThreshold]]nextDayThreshold
| Sets the minimum time that event's <<endDateTime, endDateTime>> property should achieve to render event as it if were on that day.

For instance, the property is set to `09:00:00`. And there is an event with dates:

- start - `2024-09-01T20:00:00`;
- end - `2024-09-02T02:00:00`;

So, the event spans to another day, but it will be rendered as a one-day event, because the `nextDayThreshold` property is specified. However, If the event has end date - `2024-09-02T10:00:00`, it will be rendered as two-day event.

Only affects timed events that appear on whole-days cells. Whole-day cells occur in day-grid display modes and the all-day slots in the time-grid display modes.

Note that this property is ignored when event's <<allDay, allDay>> property is set to `true`.
|

|[[noEventsText]]noEventsText
| Sets text that will be shown when no events are displayed in list display modes
|

|[[nowIndicatorVisible]]progressiveEventRendering

The property change is not applied after component attached to the UI.
| `false`

|[[progressiveEventRendering]]progressiveEventRendering
| Enables rendering of events from the data provider as soon as the events are loaded.

- `true` - renders each data provider as it is received. Will result in more renders.

- `false` - waits until all data providers have received their data and then renders everything at once, resulting in fewer renders.
| `false`

|[[scrollTime]]scrollTime
| Sets the initial scroll position to a specific time. Users will be able to scroll back to see events before this time. If you want to prevent users from doing this, use the <<slotMinTime, slotMinTime>> instead.

By default, the scroll time is reapplied to the calendar whenever the date range changes. To disable this, set <<scrollTimeReset, scrollTimeReset>> to `false`.

The property change is not applied after component attached to the UI.
| `PT6h`

|[[scrollTimeReset]]scrollTimeReset
| Sets whether the calendar should scroll to <<scrollTime, scrollTime>> every time the date range changes.

By default, whenever the date range changes, either via calendar methods or user actions, the scroll is reset. To disable this behavior, set the property to `false`.
| `true`

|[[selectConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled]]selectConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled
| Sets whether the selection must be fully contained within the week’s business hours.
It also respects custom business hours.

This property will be applied if <<selectionEnabled, selectionEnabled>> is enabled.

| Enables to select cells that contains events.
| `true`

|[[selectionEnabled]]selectionEnabled
| Allows the user to highlight multiple days or timeslots by clicking and dragging.
| `false`

|[[slotDuration]]slotDuration
| Sets the interval at which time slots are displayed.

In XML component definition, the attribute value should follow the ISO-8601 duration format, which is used by the `java.time.Duration` class.
| `PT30m`

|[[slotLabelInterval]]slotLabelInterval
| Sets the frequency for labeling time slots with text. If not specified, a reasonable value will be automatically computed based on <<slotDuration, slotDuration>>.

When specifying this property, give the `1 hour` value, this will cause the header labels to appear on the hour marks, even if the <<slotDuration, slotDuration>> was hypothetically `15` or `30` minutes long.

In XML component definition, the attribute value should follow the ISO-8601 duration format, which is used by the `java.time.Duration` class.

| `PT24h`

|[[slotMinTime]]slotMinTime
| Sets the first time slot that will be displayed for each day. The property determines the first time slot, even when the scrollbars have been scrolled all the way back.

In XML component definition, the attribute value should follow the ISO-8601 duration format, which is used by the `java.time.Duration` class.
| `PT0h`

|[[snapDuration]]snapDuration
| Sets a value that determines the time interval at which a dragged event will snap to the time axis. This also affects the granularity at which selections can be made.

| `PT30m`

|[[timeHint]]timeHint
| Sets for list display modes' non-visible table header the name of the column with days and times
|

== Handlers

In Jmix there are many xref:flow-ui:vc/common-handlers.adoc[common handlers] that are configured in the same way for all components.
The following are handlers specific to `calendar`:

include::flow-ui:vc/handler-generation-tip.adoc[]

[cols="1h,6a",grid=rows,frame=none]
|===
|*Name*|*Description*

|[[DateClickEvent]]DateClickEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.DateClickEvent` fired when a day cell or time cell is clicked.

|[[DatesSetEvent]]DatesSetEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.DatesSetEvent` fired after the calendar’s date range has been initially set or changed in some way and the DOM of component has been updated.

The calendar’s dates can change any time the user does the following:

- navigates to next and previous;
- switches the display mode;
- clicks a navigation link (e.g.week or day if <<navigationLinksEnabled, navigationLinksEnabled>> is `true`.

The dates can also change when the current-date is manipulated via the API.

|[[DayNavigationLinkClickEvent]]DayNavigationLinkClickEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.DayNavigationLinkClickEvent`  fired when the user clicks on day heading navigation link. The navigation link can be activated by the <<navigationLinksEnabled, navigationLinksEnabled>> property.

|[[EventClickEvent]]EventClickEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.EventClickEvent` fired when the calendar event is clicked.

|[[EventDropEvent]]EventDropEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.EventDropEvent` fired when the dragging stops and the event has been moved to a different day or time slot.

|[[EventMouseEnterEvent]]EventMouseEnterEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.EventMouseEnterEvent` fired when the user mouses over a calendar event.

|[[EventMouseLeaveEvent]]EventMouseLeaveEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.EventMouseLeaveEvent` fired when the user mouses out of a calendar event.

|[[EventResizeEvent]]EventResizeEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.EventResizeEvent` fired when the resizing stops and the calendar event's duration has changed.

|[[MoreLinkClickEvent]]MoreLinkClickEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.MoreLinkClickEvent` fired when the user clicks on "more" link. The "more" link can be activated by the following properties:

- <<defaultDayMaxEventRowsEnabled, defaultDayMaxEventRowsEnabled>>
- <<dayMaxEventRows, dayMaxEventRows>>
- <<defaultDayMaxEventsEnabled, defaultDayMaxEventsEnabled>>
- <<dayMaxEvents, dayMaxEvents>>

|[[SelectEvent]]SelectEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.SelectEvent` fired when a date/time selection is made.

Selection mode can be enabled by <<selectionEnabled, selectionEnabled>> property.

|[[UnselectEvent]]UnselectEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.UnselectEvent` fired when the current selection is cleared. A selection might be cleared for a number of reasons:

- The user clicks away from the current selection (doesn’t happen when <<unselectAuto, unselectAuto>> is disabled).
- The user makes a new selection. The unselect event will be fired before the new selection occurs.
- The user moves forward or backward in the current calendar's display mode, or switches to another mode.
- The `unselect()` method is called.

|[[WeekNavigationLinkClickEvent]]WeekNavigationLinkClickEvent
| `io.jmix.fullcalendarflowui.component.event.WeekNavigationLinkClickEvent` fired when the user clicks on the week number navigation link.

The navigation link can be activated by the <<navigationLinksEnabled, navigationLinksEnabled>> property.

|[[dayCellBottomTextClassNamesGenerator]]dayCellBottomTextClassNamesGenerator
| Generates CSS class names for day cell's bottom text.

Note, the generator will be invoked only if cell's bottom text is not null.

|[[dayCellBottomTextGenerator]]dayCellBottomTextGenerator
| Generates the bottom text for day cells. It applies only for day-grid month and year and display modes.

Note that in some cases, events in a cell can overlap the text at the bottom. To avoid this, it is recommended to limit the visible number of events. For instance, you can use the <<dayMaxEvents, dayMaxEvents>> property.

|[[dayCellClassNamesGenerator]]dayCellClassNamesGenerator
| Generates CSS class names for day cells. The day cell appears in day-grid and time-grid display modes as an all-day cell.

|[[dayHeaderClassNamesGenerator]]dayHeaderClassNamesGenerator
| Generates CSS class names for day headers. The day header is a cell that shows day of week and date in some display modes.

|[[moreLinkClassNamesGenerator]]moreLinkClassNamesGenerator
| Generates CSS class names for "more" link.

The generator takes precedence over other methods that set CSS class names.

|[[nowIndicatorClassNamesGenerator]]nowIndicatorClassNamesGenerator
| Generates CSS class names for a now-indicator. The now-indicator consists of two parts: the line and the axis.

The now-indicator can be enabled by <<nowIndicatorVisible, nowIndicatorVisible>> property.

|[[slotLabelClassNamesGenerator]]slotLabelClassNamesGenerator
| Generates CSS class names for the slot label, which appears as a cell with a time label in time-grid display modes.
