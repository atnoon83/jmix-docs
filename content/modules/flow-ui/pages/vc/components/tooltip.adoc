Tooltips are small pop-ups that can provide additional information about a UI element on hover and keyboard focus.

== Basics

`tooltip` is a nested element of almost all components and layouts.

TIP: To add a nested `tooltip` element in Jmix Studio, select the UI element in the view descriptor XML or in the *Jmix UI* structure panel and click on the xref:studio:screen-designer.adoc#component-inspector-add-button[Add]*->Tooltip* button in the *Jmix UI* inspector panel.

An example of defining a xref:flow-ui:vc/components/button.adoc[button] with a `tooltip`:

include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/button/button-view.xml[tags=tooltip-btn]

[[programmatic-tooltip]]
== Programmatic Definition

The `tooltip` component can be defined programmatically within your application code. Here's an example of how you can define and use `tooltip` programmatically for the `textField` component:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/component/tooltip/TooltipView.java[tags=programmaticField;onInit;set-programmatic]
----

[[about-positioning]]
== Positioning

`tooltip`, by default, positions itself relative to the target component it's attached to. It automatically calculates the best location for the tooltip to appear, taking into account the available space on the screen and avoiding overlaps with other elements.

The `position` attribute directly affects the tooltip's location on the screen, allowing you to control where the tooltip appears. The `position` attribute accepts values from the `TooltipPosition` enumeration.

You can set the `position` attribute using the `setPosition()` method in your code:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/component/tooltip/TooltipView.java[tags=set-position]
----

In the view descriptor XML, you can specify the `position` attribute:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/tooltip/tooltip-view.xml[tags=position]
----

[[configuring-delays]]
== Configuring Delays

`tooltip` provides the ability to configure delays for its appearance and disappearance, allowing you to control the timing of the tooltip's interaction with the user.

[[about-focus-delay]]
*Focus Delay*

The `focusDelay` attribute controls the delay, in milliseconds, before the tooltip appears when the mouse hovers over the component with the `tooltip` element.

In this example, the tooltip will appear after a 500-millisecond delay when the mouse hovers over the text field:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/tooltip/tooltip-view.xml[tags=focusDelay]
----

[[about-hide-delay]]
*Hide Delay*

The `hideDelay` attribute controls the delay, in milliseconds, before the tooltip hides when the mouse leaves the component with the `tooltip` element.

In this example, the tooltip will remain visible for 1 second after the mouse leaves the text field before disappearing:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/tooltip/tooltip-view.xml[tags=hideDelay]
----

[[about-hover-delay]]
*Hover Delay*

The `hoverDelay` attribute controls the delay, in milliseconds, before the tooltip appears when the mouse hovers over the component with the `tooltip` element.

In this example, the tooltip will appear after a 500-millisecond delay when the mouse hovers over the text field:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/tooltip/tooltip-view.xml[tags=hoverDelay]
----

[[triggering-manually]]
== Triggering Manually

You can configure tooltips to appear programmatically, meaning they won't show on hover or focus, but only when triggered by your code. This is particularly useful when:

* You need to display the tooltip based on specific conditions or user interactions.
* The tooltip content needs to be dynamically generated or updated.

In the view descriptor XML, set the `manual` attribute to `true`. This indicates that the tooltip will not be displayed automatically and requires manual control.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/resources/com/company/onboarding/view/component/tooltip/tooltip-view.xml[tags=manual]
----

Then configure the tooltip within the view controller.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/onboarding/src/main/java/com/company/onboarding/view/component/tooltip/TooltipView.java[tags=manualTextField;uiComponents;onInit;manual;createHelperButton]
----

<1> The `opened` attribute controls whether the tooltip is currently visible. It's a boolean value, with `true` indicating the tooltip is open and `false` indicating it's closed.

NOTE: While `opened` can be set manually, it's typically managed by the framework itself based on events such as mouse hover or focus. The attribute is useful for controlling `tooltip` visibility in scenarios where you need to programmatically open or close it.

== Attributes

The following are attributes specific to `tooltip`:

[cols="1h,5,1", grid=rows, frame=none]
|===
|*Name*
|*Description*
|*Default*
|[[focusDelay]]focusDelay
|Defines the delay in milliseconds before the tooltip is opened on keyboard focus, when not in manual mode. See <<about-focus-delay,Focus Delay>>.
|`0`
|[[hideDelay]]hideDelay
|Defines the delay in milliseconds before the tooltip is closed on losing hover, when not in manual mode. On blur, the tooltip is closed immediately. See <<about-hide-delay,Hide Delay>>.
|`0`
|[[hoverDelay]]hoverDelay
|Defines the delay in milliseconds before the tooltip is opened on hover, when not in manual mode. See <<about-hover-delay,Hover Delay>>.
|`0`
|[[manual]]manual
|When `true`, the tooltip is controlled programmatically instead of reacting to focus and mouse events. See <<triggering-manually,Triggering Manually>>.
|`false`
|[[opened]]opened
|When `true`, the tooltip is opened programmatically. Only works if `manual` is set to `true`. See <<triggering-manually,Triggering Manually>>.
|`false`
|[[position]]position
|Defines the position of the tooltip with respect to its target. See <<about-positioning,Positioning>>.
|
|[[text]]text
|Defines the string used as a tooltip content.
