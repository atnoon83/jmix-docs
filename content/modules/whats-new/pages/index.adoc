= What's New

This section covers new features of Jmix framework and Studio {page-component-display-version}, as well as some breaking changes to be aware of when upgrading from a previous version of the framework.

[[upgrade]]
== How To Upgrade

[IMPORTANT]
====
To create new projects with Jmix {page-component-display-version} or to upgrade an existing project, you need Studio {page-component-display-version} or later, so xref:studio:update.adoc[update] your Jmix Studio plugin first.

The minimal supported IntelliJ IDEA version is now {minimal-idea-version}.
====

See xref:studio:project.adoc#upgrading-project[Upgrading Project] section for how to upgrade your project using Studio. The automatic migration procedure makes the following changes in your project:

* Updates the version of Jmix BOM which in turn defines versions of all dependencies.
* Updates the version of Jmix Gradle plugin.
* Updates the version of Gradle wrapper to 8.8 in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`.
* If the project includes the REST API add-on, adds the `jmix.resource-server.authenticated-url-patterns` property, see details <<protecting-generic-rest-endpoints,below>>.
* Replaces calls to `dateTimeParameter()`, `dateParameter()` and `timeParameter()` methods of input dialog builder with calls to `localDateTimeParameter()`, `localDateParameter()` and `localTimeParameter()`. See details <<input-dialog-date-parameters,below>>.
* Adds the Grid Export Actions add-on to the project if it includes the Data Tools add-on. See details <<grid-export-actions-add-on-dependency,below>>.
* Sets the xref:flow-ui:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.default-trim-enabled[jmix.ui.component.default-trim-enabled] application property to `false`. See details <<trimming-in-text-fields,below>>.

See also the full list of <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>> that can affect your project after the upgrade.

[[updated-dependencies]]
== Updated Dependencies

The following major dependencies have been updated:

* Spring Boot https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.3-Release-Notes[3.3^].

* Vaadin https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases/tag/24.4.0[24.4^].

[[new-features]]
== New Features and Improvements

[[new-add-ons]]
=== New Add-ons

The following new add-ons are now available:

* The *FullCalendar* add-on provides a UI component that allows you to show data-bound events in a calendar with various views (day, week, month, etc.) and edit them by dragging and resizing.

* The *PivotTable* add-on provides a UI component that enables turning a data set into a summary table and manipulating it using 2D drag-and-drop UI.

* The xref:kanban:index.adoc[] add-on provides a UI component that represents a Kanban board. It shows workflow at different stages of a project, using cards for tasks and columns for stages.

* The xref:uiconstraints:index.adoc[] add-on allows you to control the visibility and accessibility of UI components using declarative policies defined in resource roles.

* The xref:rest-ds:index.adoc[] add-on allows you to access external entities from a remote Jmix application through the standard `DataManager` interface in the same way as local JPA entities.

[[data-binding-for-html-components]]
=== Data Binding for HTML Components

The xref:flow-ui:vc/html.adoc[HTML components] like `div`, `span`, `h1`...`h5` and others can now be bound to your data model entities declaratively in XML using the `dataContainer` and `property` attributes.

In many cases this will save you from writing code to set values in these components programmatically in view controllers.

[[asynchronous-tasks]]
=== Asynchronous Tasks

The new xref:flow-ui:async-tasks.adoc[UiAsyncTasks] bean allows you to execute an operation in a separate thread using the security context of the current user, and then update the UI with the result of that operation.

In comparison to xref:flow-ui:background-tasks.adoc[], this is a lightweight mechanism based on `CompletableFuture`.

[[trimming-in-text-fields]]
=== Trimming in Text Fields

The `textField` and `textArea` components now have the xref:flow-ui:vc/components/textField.adoc#trimEnabled[trimEnabled] attribute which controls whether the component trims spaces at the beginning and at the end of the entered string.

The xref:flow-ui:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.default-trim-enabled[jmix.ui.component.default-trim-enabled] application property specifies the default value of this attribute for the whole application. In new projects, this property is `true`. The Studio migration procedure sets this property to `false` for existing projects to minimize changes in behavior.

[[immediate-validation-of-required-fields]]
=== Immediate Validation of Required Fields

The new xref:flow-ui:ui-properties.adoc#jmix.ui.component.immediate-required-validation-enabled[jmix.ui.component.immediate-required-validation-enabled] application property allows you to disable validation of required fields on view opening.

[[grid-export-options]]
=== Grid Export Options

When using the xref:grid-export:index.adoc[] add-on, the set of export options can now be defined by a particular export action using its `setAvailableExportModes()` method and corresponding `availableExportModes` property in XML. The default set of options is defined by the xref:grid-export:properties.adoc#jmix.gridexport.default-export-modes[jmix.gridexport.default-export-modes] application property.

[[advanced-endpoints-security-configuration]]
=== Advanced Endpoints Security Configuration

More options have been introduced for configuring endpoints security when using Authorization Server or OpenID Connect add-ons:

* `jmix.resource-server.authenticated-url-patterns` and `jmix.resource-server.anonymous-url-patterns` properties
* `AuthenticatedUrlPatternsProvider` and `AnonymousUrlPatternsProvider`
* `AuthenticatedRequestMatcherProvider` and `AnonymousRequestMatcherProvider`

See xref:security:custom-endpoints.adoc#token-based-authentication[Token Based Authentication] for more information.

The old `AuthorizedUrlsProvider` is deprecated, but still works, as well as `jmix.rest.authenticated-url-patterns` and `jmix.rest.anonymous-url-patterns` properties. It is recommended to move the configuration to the new interfaces or properties.

[[breaking-changes]]
== Breaking Changes

[[build-problem-with-enablejmixdatarepositories]]
=== Build Problem With EnableJmixDataRepositories

When `@EnableJmixDataRepositories` is used on the main application class extending `AppShellConfigurator`, a clean build fails with the following message:

[source]
----
> Task :vaadinPrepareFrontend FAILED
Could not read com.vaadin.flow.theme.Theme annotation from class com.company.onboarding.OnboardingApplication.
java.lang.TypeNotPresentException: Type [unknown] not present
----

The problem is caused by https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/19616[vaadin/flow#19616^] and will be fixed in a future patch.

To work around the problem, move the `@EnableJmixDataRepositories` annotation to a separate `@Configuration` class in the same package, for example:

[source,java]
----
package com.company.onboarding;

import io.jmix.core.repository.EnableJmixDataRepositories;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@EnableJmixDataRepositories
@Configuration
public class OnboardingConfiguration {
}
----

[[protecting-generic-rest-endpoints]]
=== Protecting Generic REST Endpoints

Due to improvements in endpoints security configuration (see <<advanced-endpoints-security-configuration,above>>), the following application property must be set to secure the Generic REST API endpoints:

[source,properties]
----
jmix.resource-server.authenticated-url-patterns = /rest/**
----

The Studio migration procedure adds it to `application.properties` automatically.

[[listmenu-styles]]
=== ListMenu Styles

xref:flow-ui:vc/components/listMenu.adoc[] component styles have been changed to fix the issue with focus ring:

- Changed margin and padding for the `ListMenu` itself.
- Increased `margin-inline-start` for list of sub menu.
- Changed paddings for `MenuBarItem`.

If you have defined your own styles for this component, you may need to adjust them.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3589[#3589^] for more information.

[[input-dialog-date-parameters]]
=== Input Dialog Date Parameters

The `dateTimeParameter()`, `dateParameter()` and `timeParameter()` methods of the xref:flow-ui:dialogs.adoc#input-dialog[input dialog] builder have been fixed: now they create parameters of `java.util.Date`, `java.sql.Date` and `java.sql.Time` type respectively. Previously they wrongly created `LocalDateTime`, `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` parameters.

See https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3499[#3499^] for more information.

The Studio migration procedure automatically replaces calls to these methods with calls to `localDateTimeParameter()`, `localDateParameter()` and `localTimeParameter()` to keep compatibility with returning values.

[[grid-export-actions-add-on-dependency]]
=== Grid Export Actions Add-on Dependency

Previously, the xref:data-tools:index.adoc[] add-on contained transitive dependency to the xref:grid-export:index.adoc[] add-on. This dependency has been removed, so now export actions can be used only when the Grid Export Actions add-on is included explicitly.

The Studio migration procedure automatically adds the Grid Export Actions add-on to the project if it includes the Data Tools add-on.
